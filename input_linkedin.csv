Bhavana Issar + Caregiver Saathi (Headline + About + JD),"Dignifying Care-related Work & Valuing Emotional Labour to unlock the potential of Women ? Founder CEO: Caregiver Saathi I HR - OD Consultant: Sambhaavna I Coach I Speaker I Motorcyclist I Limca record holder Care related work is the invisible engine of economy and the very essence of human existence. Over the years this aspect of life has been relegated to gendered roles in across communities and cultures. As we build a world of gender equality, it is imperative that we account for the care-related work that goes unnoticed and undervalued. Caregiver Saathi is an attempt to institutionalize care-related work and value its contribution in building an inclusive world. It is also the ikigai for Bhavana as it is at the intersection of her life experience, professional and academic qualifications and dreams. Bhavana comes with nearly 25+ years of experience in diverse global companies as a consultant, an HR leader and a passionate person with diverse interests. She brings practical experience of accomplishments inside organisations along with a depth of professional knowledge, which she continues to challenge and build. She is the Founder & CEO Sambhaavna (www.sambhaavna.com), a business consulting firm and Caregiver Saathi (www.caregiversaathi.co.in) , a social enterprise that aims to create an ecosystem of well-being for the informal caregivers who are the primary caregivers to a family member with terminally illness or with chronic medical conditions. Additionally, she is Fellow and practicing facilitator in Process Work & OD Practitioner with Sumedhas Academy for Human Context (www.sumedhas.org ) Global Ambassador for Global Moto Adventures (www.globalmotoadv.com), a platform that supports women motorcyclists to achieve their dreams.Visiting faculty at Indian Institute for Management, Ahmedabad (www.iima.ac.in)She believes that we thrive in organizations or spaces that are co-created, trusting, gently challenging with honest and direct communication. Such spaces are the bedrock for multiple perspectives and only when there are multiple and diverse perspectives, can we inspire new possibilities (“Sambhaavna” in Sanskrit/Hindi).Being a motorcycle rider has helped her discover herself by pushing the boundaries of mind, body and soul and creating new possibilities, something she passionately believes in and wishes to live. While there are many ways of describing her - from a romantic poet to a relentless activist, what she relates to the most, is curious learner and an adventurous explorer. Caregiver Saathi (www.caregiversaathi.co.in) is an endeavour to acknowledge and support Caregivers of patients with terminal illness or chronic conditions, so that together we can improve the quality of their lives, their well-being and those that they care for.Saathi is Hindi for “companion” and we believe caregivers of terminally ill patients need a friend who understands, supports and is there for them as they walk along the difficult path of supporting their loved ones.There are many ways in which a caregiver is challenged and often the caregiver also needs care, emotional support, understanding, easy access to information, guidance from experts and wisdom from others who have similar experiences. It is our endeavour to bring it all together and make it easy access for the caregiver.We want to create an integrated ecosystem of well-being for those family members who are primary caregivers to their dear ones battling chronic medical conditions or terminal illness. We partner with doctors, health practitioners, employers and well-wishers of caregivers to build a supportive community for the caregivers. www.caregiversaathi.co.in At Sambhaavna (www.sambhaavna.com) we are passionate about working with individuals, teams and organisations, who want to change, grow and make a difference. It is particularly gratifying for me to visualize change and and then see it manifest, both at the individual and at the organization level. With over 20 years of experience in diverse global companies either as an HR leader or as a consultant and coach, I bring practical experience of accomplishments inside organisations along with a depth of professional knowledge which I continue to develop.While there are many ways of describing me - ranging from a romantic poet to a cynical activist, what I would relate to the most would be a curious learner and an adventurous biker.I believe we thrive in organizations or spaces that are co-created, trusting, gently challenging with honest and direct communication. Such spaces are the bedrock for multiple perspectives and only when there are multiple and diverse perspectives, can we create new possibilities (“Sambhaavna” in Sanskrit/Hindi).Currently, I partner with organizations in the areas of Strategic Human Resources, Organization Development, Capability Building and Talent Management. My areas of interest include Change and transitions, Innovation, Creative expression, group dynamics and transpersonal psychology.There are many customised ways in which we partner with organizations ranging from long-term agreements (12-36 months) for change as a part of organization development to short-term project-based interventions (5-6 workshops) for capability building, leadership development or results-based executive coaching (9-18 months). As a member of a network of associates, we partner with other OD consultants to service the needs of the organizations.As an Entrepreneur, I run a social organization called Caregiver Saathi which provides support and wellbeing to caregivers of family members who are terminally ill or have chronic conditions."

We're building a digital Makerspace (just like a physical Makerspace but online) to engage kids in authentic, real-world, hands-on STEM projects without the hassles of buying and organizing physical supplies.

Educators believe this is the best way to prepare kids for an uncertain future. Top curriculums (e.g.- NGSS, IB, etc.) already mandate hands-on learning and other curriculums (CBSE, ICSE, State, etc.) are following suit. But running hands-on STEM projects and achieving meaningful, authentic learning outcomes in the classroom is very hard.

Dhiraj Rajaram + Mu Sigma,"Data is the new crude) oil. Supply chains built on physical goods have been replaced in importance by decision supply chains. Competitive differentiation is no longer in the creation of analytics, but in the consumption of analytics. But there’s a problem.The amount of data generated in the world doubles every 18 months, yet there’s a dearth of impact. Products are not flexible. IT-led waterfall model is not agile and reacts badly to changing scope. Management consulting operates through proxy knowledge. We need a new paradigm. And it’s why I founded Mu Sigma – to build a man-machine ecosystem that helps companies institutionalize the decision supply chain.The new paradigm is built on our belief system that all living things thrive better in a state of flow, which is a harmony between order and chaos. There are three fundamental governing principles underpinning our company: 1) L = d/dt K): Learning over Knowing2) X^2: Extreme Experimentation over Experts 3) The New IP: Not intellectual property, but interaction property through an interdisciplinary perspectiveAs founder of Mu Sigma, I’m responsible for our strategic direction. Prior to founding the company, I worked at Booz Allen Hamilton and PwC. The experience working with Fortune 500 companies made me realize that there was more to analytics than just data and black box models. Big companies need a better art of problem solving. Mu Sigma’s aim is to teach them how to fish, not just give them the fish. And in doing so, leave behind a bit of the Mu Sigma mindset in every client. Visit us @ www.mu-sigma.com"

We're working with AI and ML companies in the Bay Area. Every week, we meet at least one company that is experiencing the sales cycle-of-doom. The sales teams end up getting fired, or the marketing team is being reshuffled. All this wastes time in the market, and even a great product will lose momentum, not to mention expensive VC money. But why is this happening? B2B sales is changing, and a completely new approach is needed to develop markets. Without a complete team, market development efforts will be half-hearted and unresponsive.

Joy Prabhakaran + Self-employed,"I started my career in 1989 and I have played different roles. For about ten years, I ran my own business. Subsequently, I worked for a few big companies for another decade. Since 2011, I did my PhD and also consulted with Yahoo, Wipro, TCS and IIIT-Bangalore. I set up an experimental site called Recoplace and ran it for two years. Recoplace was an attempt to gather recommendations from all over the world, with a focus on home remedies practiced in different places and cultures.I completed my PhD in Jan 2018. Since then I have been a Professor at KSIT and a Consultant to different companies. An offshoot of my Doctoral work has led to an improved edge detection method. I have used this method to help improve the quality of retinal images of premature babies. The goal is to improve detection of Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) when diagnostics is done remotely. The method is undergoing clinical trials in two hospitals. I work as a technical consultant with different companies. My work is broadly around analytics using video and images. I have worked with NeST (now part of Quest) to help bring a new team up to speed on Video technologies required for a surveillance application. I have worked with Wipro to help build analytics solutions for retail applications. I have worked with TCS on an IP component that I proposed to them. This was to measure End User Video Quality for internet video providers. I work with a few startups to help conceive and design solutions in the space of autonomous vehicles, mobile apps and security. Recoplace is a social media platform to share and find credible recommendations from people one knows. People benefit a lot from high quality recommendations. Many of us have come to treasure a book someone recommended or maybe music someone introduced us to and many other things we “discovered” because of someone. A special kind of discovery is home cures. Cures that someone recommends, and sometimes, works like magic. Recoplace makes the sharing and discovering of recommendations easier. Courses I offer are in two areas, low level communication technologies and video technologies. My research is totally focused on Video technologies for the internet and mobility space. In 2013 I have had around 20 grad students working with me on semester long projects in the area of Video technologies. All these projects, directly or indirectly, explored concepts of quality in internet video."

Narendra Modi + Prime Minister of India,"Dynamic, dedicated and determined, Narendra Modi arrives as a ray of hope in the lives of a billion Indians. His laser focus on development and proven ability to deliver results have made him one of India’s most popular leaders. His promise is to build a nation that is strong, prosperous and inclusive, where each and every Indian can realize their hopes and aspirations. Narendra Modi made his mark on both the Indian and global stage as the chief minister of the western state of Gujarat for a record 4 terms. There, he brought about a paradigm shift in people’s lives by delivering pro-citizen good governance. He transformed Gujarat, which was reeling from the aftereffects of a devastating earthquake, into a growth engine that made a strong contribution to India’s development. Under his leadership Gujarat Government won over 300 awards at the domestic and international level. Narendra Modi has achieved all this thanks to hard work and the values instilled in his childhood. Born on 17 September 1950 in a small town in Gujarat, he grew up in a loving but poor family ‘without a spare rupee’. The initial hardships of life not only taught the value of hard work but also revealed to him the avoidable sufferings of the common people. That is why as chief minister, he lived his life by the principle of ‘Antyodaya’, of serving the last person in the queue. From a very young age he immersed himself in service to the nation, working with patriotic organisations. He is a ‘people’s leader’. His powerful, personal ‘connect’ on the ground is complemented by a strong presence online where he is known as India’s most techno-savvy leader, using the web to reach people and bring about change in their lives. He is very active on social media, including Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and other forums. This is the man, an embodiment of courage, compassion and conviction, on whom the nation has bestowed its mandate, hoping that he will rejuvenate India and make it a bright beacon to the world."

Rakesh Nagaraj,"VP & GM - APAC at HackerRank. HackerRank is making the world flat... fast! Our mission is to build a meritocratic platform that makes the world flat – where the only thing that matters is your actual objectively-measured skill and not which school you went to or the companies you’ve been at, or your gender, or how privileged you’ve been. HackerRank is a fast growing technical talent community used by programmers to hone their coding skills and by companies to recruit tech talent. It's about SKILL not school. It really is that simple. What school you went to doesn't mean you're a great engineer, it means you went to that school. Hackerrank is here to help organizations identify the best engineering talent by the work product they produce. Simple. You get a high score on a code challenge, you're qualified. Low score - you're not qualified. Simple! Our customers can now look beyond Tier 1 engineering schools or only at top engineering companies and find skilled engineer talent where they current live - everywhere. The publicly accessible platform found at HackerRank.com is a community where coders go to compete for fun, education, prizes, and jobs. Programming problems span several domains including artificial intelligence and algorithms. Companies can also participate on this platform by sponsoring challenges that can include real-world problems that any coder in the world can compete to try and solve. HackerRank for Work is our B2B enterprise product and is a set of tools for technical interviewing and assessment that sits on top of our platform. These tools simplify the interview process for any company that hires engineers. HackerRank for Work can be found at http://www.hackerrank.com/work. Taking on larger responsibilities of growing the team and region. Continued to manage & grow the team and business through these years. In these three years, particularly proud of the growth we achieved along with the professional transformation of team members taking up different roles with larger responsibilities. Presidents club FY 2017, 2018, 2019 & 2020. As part of my role here at HackerRank, I am responsible for sales of India and APAC. My primary responsibility includes increasing awareness of our solutions and growing sales in our most important and promising geography. I have the privilege of inheriting a small rock star team and build it up from here. Entrusted with the task of expanding our presence across geographies. I also consider it an honor to be working with some of the most brilliant tech minds internally and externally as part of this role. In this role as Senior Enterprise Relationship Manager, I handled some of our large India & global Strategic customers and I consulted and enabled them to achieve their hiring objectives on a global scale. I had the good fortune to work closely with some very talented, brilliant and seasoned industry veterans. Everyday was a wonderful learning experience. I enjoyed spending time with my clients, showing them some amazing data insights that enabled them make some business critical decisions. What I loved about my role was that I got to spend time with grass root level sourcers/recruiters as well as Exec & CXO's, wherein I got to do customized workshops and to show them the power of LinkedIn and social media in general and how it was changing the face of recruiting. As the first Enterprise Relationship Manager in the south of India, I took over the task of handling all our SMB, Enterprise and Strategic customers. I was the third employee of our line of business at our Bangalore office. The best part of this stint was that I felt like an entrepreneur, since I was the first Relationship Manager for the south and I had to set up things for myself. This was an extremely exciting phase wherein I was establishing the foundation of our business and very proud to say that my stint here help lay a very strong foundation for the other Relationship Managers who joined after me. As a Relationship Manager, wherein LinkedIn was in its infancy in India, my immediate job was to make sure all our clients adopted LinkedIn's Talent Solutions and were setting up themselves for success with this medium. This would include a lot of education and hand holding. I traveled pretty extensively to all client locations in India during this phase to ensure that all users and stake holders across levels were educated and brought up to speed on social media and LinkedIn in specific. Making LinkedIn a way of life for my clients was our vision and still continues to be! During this phase of my career, I moved into an Individual contributor role and handled some of our larger strategic customers. Primarily my task involved customer retention and satisfaction. I was assigned a set of some of our large customers in Bangalore and I would meet up with them, assess their hiring needs/challenges, propose solutions to help achieve those challenges, organize trainings, up sell and renew them. I was part of the Key Accounts team which was responsible for probably >50% of the branch revenues. This was technically my first sales job and the one that probably laid the foundation for my sales career. I was one of the first few employees of our Bangalore branch and had the opportunity to see and learn how a business is scaled up. Naukri.com was pretty much in its infancy and this phase of my career saw me start off as a feet on street field sales person to handling a team of 4 members. I enjoyed every role that I played. I was assigned a territory within Bangalore and my task was to ensure that the entire territory is mapped and we have demonstrated and educated our prospects on our solutions. All the efforts put in initially with all the cold calls led to prospects being converted to clients.During this stint of mine, I also helped set up our new office space right from identifying the office space to getting everything from the wood work to electrical fittings to interiors to almost everything in the office set up. Apart from being a full time sales professional, I did this purely for the love of it and very proud of this even today!"

Vinay Shenoy,"Engineering Lead at Qweebi. Lead a team that was working on the mobile application of Simple.org, a product designed for monitoring and enabling better control of non-communicable diseases, focusing on hypertension and diabetes. Over the course of a few years, the product has gone on to be deployed across 5.7k health facilities in 3 countries, and is tracking hypertension and diabetes history for over 1.4 million patients. The product went on to win ""Best In Show"" at IXDA 2020 (https://www.simple.org/blog/simple-wins-best-in-show/). Apart from building the product itself, many of my responsibilities included building the engineering part of Obvious.in itself. This included things like: - Setting up regular 1:1s with members of my team and coming up with growth plans and ways to execute on these. - Work on tools and processes to continuously improve the continuous integration and deployment pipelines. - Designing and implementing a hiring pipeline to evaluate engineers at different experience levels. Was the lead engineer of SpaceCraft, a first-in-class online home interior visualization platform that was designed to drastically improve the home interior shopping experience. Worked on multiple layers of the product stack, some of the key pieces I had a hand in building were: - A tablet application used by the home interior designer to construct a virtual scene on the customer's browser application, fully integrated with HomeLane's existing pricing engine. - Working with the web frontend team to design a protocol (based on WebSockets) for communicating in real-time between the tablet application and web based customer application. - Took the lead on building the first version of the backend of SpaceCraft, which would enable the management of the inventory on the SpaceCraft tool by the internal interior design team. This product eventually led to the reduction of the sales cycle at HomeLane by over 50%. Was one of the early employees for a startup that was aiming to improve the home interior shopping experience by building visualization solutions using modern technologies like WebGL. Saw the company through an acquisition by HomeLane.com.As part of this role, worked on multiple kinds of applications both consumer focused and internal. Some of the key pieces of software I worked on: - Building an internal tool to streamline the upload process for 3D assets to the asset servers, which drastically reduced the time required and the chance of human errors when uploading assets. - Prototyping a virtual-reality experience for visualizing home interiors and deployed it in multiple showrooms across Bengaluru. Worked on the Flipkart e-Books mobile application. In this role, I took on the task on streamlining some of the underlying systems used for client-server communication and making future feature development a smoother experience."

After quitting my first job at BYJUs in Dec 2012, I decided to take a 1-year break to figure out 'what next'. To survive in B'luru, I did a bunch of odd jobs ?? ?? started tutoring a couple of French kids at a nearby apartment in the evenings; grew to 4 via word of mouth ?? ?? helped an ex-colleague get his offline coaching biz off the ground on weekends ? started freelance writing; my first article was for a publication called trak.in. It went viral according to Arun Prabhudesai (the founder and Chief Editor at that point in time). During this 10-11 month period, startups had started getting attention. Bangalore was the hub! ?? YourStory (YS) and PluggdIn (now NextBigWhat) were the only two media entities that really cared about Startups back then. I'd make time to attend startup events - mostly by YourStory. I remember meeting Joe Gebbia* at the YS office (which was a 3.5 BHK on the 2nd floor of a 3-story building right behind Toit in Indiranagar). 40-50 of us crammed in a small hall to listen to *the co-founder of Airbnb - one of the biggest startup stories from the US. ?? After a while, having attended several meetups, I got to know each and every member of the (then small) team at YS. I remember Shradha Sharma (Founder, YourStory) offered me a lift back from one such conference at Taj Yeshwanthpur in Oct 2013. We stopped for ice cream at a Häagen-Dazs in 1-MG mall. This is where she asked me to join YourStory to help with community building. I already knew the team members + having started a startup while still in college I was massively curious about startups. This decision was a no-brainer. I joined YourStory as a consultant in Nov, '13. This was the best thing that happened to me. I learned Marketing on the job. ?? That's my career break story ?? #IAmProfessional"

Ashu Garg,"In 2008, I joined Foundation Capital as a General Partner because I thought it would be a great opportunity to apply my lifelong learning of scaling organizations to help entrepreneurs succeed in achieving their vision. I get most excited about B2B/enterprise software. Like many of the partners at Foundation Capital, my background is as an operator. I’ve spent 15 years in a variety of roles that have taught me some important lessons . I’ve applied these lessons to being the type of board member who truly acts as a partner to the entrepreneurs by being a friend and supporter, but also a challenger, and through that, hopefully helping the founder to achieve their highest aspirations. I feel very privileged to be an early investor in Databricks (valued at $38B) and 6 other unicorns (Cohesity, Eightfold, Amperity, Turing, Anyscale and Alation). One of my high points as a VC was when one of my CEOs told me that he enjoys putting me in front of his entire team [in all hands meetings] because he felt it has a positive impact on internal motivation and in turn, the bottom line. I was so grateful to receive this kind of feedback because helping my portfolio companies succeed is my main goal as a VC. One way I realize this is through my unconditional commitment to stand by a founder’s side as we work together to make their company a success throughout all of the highs and lows a startup naturally experiences. One thing that I’ve learned through my operational experience is being able to really zoom in and focus on important issues that will improve a product or the overall user experience. I’m not really a fade-into-the-background kind of guy. What I mean by that is I am committed to delivering constructive feedback in a respectful way if I feel it will propel growth forward, even if it can get uncomfortable at times. However, I also believe I am good at knowing when to step aside and let the entrepreneur execute. Follow me @ashugarg"

We help medical centers and expert physicians connect with patients and healthcare consumers when faced with serious medical conditions. Expertscape identifies and objectively ranks medical expertise in over 30,000 specific topics. When someone is diagnosed with a serious condition, it is incredibly challenging to find a truly knowledgeable physician for a second opinion or more specialized treatment. And healthcare institutions have highly-ranked expertise that they don't know about, so can't brag about them. We help solve both of those difficult data problems for academic medical centers and others in the healthcare space. And I've written a book on sales fundamentals, SALES CRAFT, that outlines 50 fundamental sales skills, practices and ideas that every sales professional should consider as they work to improve their sales effectiveness. Kiinetics is a specialty B2B sales coaching and consulting practice. Emphasis is on sales strategy and techniques, marketing, customer success and relationship management. Particular industry experience helping healthcare technology companies advance their sales success into health plan, ACO and health system markets.I chat about early-stage startups, sales fundamentals, and other quick tips and ideas for the B2B startup founder.

Gautam Mago,"General Partner, A91 Partners. The reallocation of priorities among startups is welcome and long overdue. What we also need is a (private) acceptance of responsibility by companies and investors - if capital was being misallocated, it didn’t misallocate itself. Decisions were made that led to the misallocation. Owning up to mistakes is step 1 of being able to correct them and build a foundation for an enduring business. Amazing to see how much the company has achieved even since we first met you. Vinayak S. Saket Dandotia Alok Patil - Kaushik Anand, I and all of A91 Partners are glad to be your partners and embarking on the next leg of this journey with you. We look forward to building a great company together! Today we are pleased to announce the closing of $550M A91 Fund II. We are incredibly grateful to both our investors and the founders that have partnered with us and continue to inspire and educate us every day. We started A91 in 2018 with the following beliefs - the nature of entrepreneurship in India is changing, more new age businesses will be created, and patient capital will play an important role in accelerating value creation. We also believed in the opportunity to create a world-class Indian investment firm - for founders who are aiming to build large enduring businesses from India, for either local or global markets. All these beliefs have been strengthened over the last 3 years. While it is early in our journey at A91, we aspire to be enduring ourselves, and be long-term partners to founders. We are delighted to take one more step along our journey to partner with the next generation of founders building enduring businesses.

We focus on forward-looking medical device companies that want to run a first-in-human clinical trial and want to have long-term sales growth in the region. We promise that by engaging with us as your CRO, regulatory, or market access consultants, your company will cost-effectively get the clinical data it needs or will be able to increase its sales in Colombia and the rest of Latin America. WHAT OTHERS SAY: ? ""Obtaining approval for a foreign study is always a challenge. bioaccess.’s assistance was invaluable in getting our study approved i Colombia...bioaccess.™ has the ability to identify and troubleshoot potential problems before they arise. For companies considering a trial in Colombia, I recommend bioaccess.™ without hesitation.” —Robert Berman, CEO, Hancock Jaffe Laboratories, Inc. ? ""I can only say good things about our experience in Colombia."" —John B. Simpson, MD. CEO, Avinger, Inc. ?“This decision to engage bioaccess.™ was made to increase our focus and visibility within South America. It is of the utmost importance that we partner with distributors that have influence and a good track record within the Colombian market. We also need speedy access to potential clinical trials to ensure we add value with our product offering as well as clinically proven outcomes.

LATAM Medtech Leaders delivers insightful interviews with leaders of medical technology companies with meaningful experience conducting first-in-human trials or with the commercialization of their medical devices in Latin America. They talk about their experiences in the region and provide a pathway for other leaders to follow so that they can save time and avoid costly mistakes. bioaccess.™ is a US-based contract research organization (CRO), regulatory, and market access consulting company that delivers a full spectrum of offerings from bench to commercialization so that medical device design and development companies can have long-term success in Colombia and the rest of Latin America. As CEO, I work with company executives to formulate a clinical trial/market access/regulatory/sales strategy in Colombia that gets the results they need. ? Three areas essential for successful market entry in Colombia: ? Follow the advice of the US Department of Commerce: “It is strongly recommended that U.S. companies process the registration under their name and not under the local distributor name, as if it is listed under the local distributor name, the U.S. company will not be able to change or add distributors, during the lifetime of the registration, which is ten years.” ? Legal Representation - If you decide not to set-up a business entity and have a local presence in Colombia, you are required to appoint a local legal representative as part of your regulatory approval process. Your legal representative will manage your product registration submission and will interact with the MoH/INVIMA on your behalf. ? Distributors - Most relationships that initially seemed promising, begin to deteriorate when the distributor doesn't meet its sales goals. In most cases, these misalignments can be avoided through careful and professional due diligence and planning. The problem is that most bio/pharma and medical device manufacturers don't have the time or experience to do it well. Seek the help of a market access consultant.

But when entering another continent or part of one, an additional set of problems will likely arise. Every company faces a challenge when developing new markets, especially if these markets are found in other world regions.

Kakoli Das,"Strategic Projects | LinkedIn Content Accelerator| Entrepreneur | Career Re-Start Mentor| Conscious Woman and D & I Leader I am playful, curious and adventurous. I have taken risks and I continue to take risks, to come home to myself. I am one of those who believe I was born to create an impact in the world. I know I am breaking the Linked template of ""About Me"" here, but this is the only was I know me. I have about 12+ years of working full time. The biggest chunk of my experience has been in retail – in the merchandising, supply chain and inventory management area. I also have experience in client servicing and managing deliveries. • Of all the things, I am proud of re-launching my career, in not so normal circumstance, after a gap of 6 years. • I launched a sustainable e-commerce business when both sustainability and e-commerce were very rarely used words, called The Red River. ( https://yourstory.com/2010/07/kakoli-das-founder-the-red-river-red-river-trading-company-pvt-ltd/amp) • I have a width of experience in retail – from forecasting essentials to allocating highly seasonal premium fashion, from building MVPs as augmentation for enterprise tools for specific usage, to setting up teams from scratch for new processes or transition established processes to India. I work well in the cusp of business and technology. I can speak both the language relatively well, and thus can get things done, to achieve the business outcomes. My strength is I understand consumer behaviors and pain points, and am very clued into the brand, its offer and the target consumer, which helps me connect the dots in data and look for usability in technical solution. • I have built products in the past, and have experience building product roadmaps, and go-to-market strategies. • Connection is my strength. I am intuitive with people and build connections effortlessly .That has helped me manage teams well – and I manage teams from the space of inspiration. I believe everyone performs better when they feel better about themselves. The ability to build trust has also helped me build, nurture and strengthen a rich stakeholder network. • I am a story-teller. I tell stories all the time – to inspire, to spark joy. I am particularly interested in usage of content/stories to build identity, inspiration, influence and engagement. • I am passionate about creating an equal world. I was part of the founding core D & I team, and lead the Women in business pillar. I, along with the team, chalked out goals for the organization and executed key strategies. • And lastly, I work best, I come alive when I have flexibility and freedom. I am a woman and a mum, and proud of who I have become while parenting. Un-Script started as my compassion project, part of graduation project for Conscious Woman Leadership Program, run by Shenomics. I explore the idea of un-learning our life script to break shackles of conditioning, self limiting beliefs and/or gender roles to find our joy by embracing our authentic self. The objective is to bring out more and more stories of women who have broken some molds while following their joy, to inspire many more women to follow their joy. The world needs joyful people, and this is my contribution to create a world of joy. You can find the series here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcin0F-MWks&list=PLEaAcBeoJjm0CNn4B4CxYUGdJoeR5kfqn Lead a team of Location Planners and Allocation Analysts supporting brand sales, margin, and inventory objectives of the $3.5 B combined business of Ann Taylor, LOFT and Lou & Grey. Work in partnership with internal brand partners and Accenture to develop pre-season sales plans at the location level to influence the Merchandise & Assortment Planning Processes with a goal of optimizing margin opportunities at the location/department/class level. Was responible for managing inventory flow for the $ 20 B F & B vertical of Target - both perishable as well as dry grocery. Led a team of supply chain analysts to remotely manage inventory flow for regular sales as well promotions in the omni channel environment through for the temp controlled F & B supply chain. - Demand planning for all 18,000 stores for all divisions in F & B including newly launched Adult Beverage - Building SHM for allocation for different format stores making adjustments for flexible fulfilment - Promotion management to increase sales and reduce wastage, especially for produce and dairy - Set up a global team of inventory experts for inventory resolution for all 1800 stores across all SKUs. This team resolved Out Of stock, Over Stock issues for all store formats and for all item types across departments . The team played a strategic role in the brand launches - which was critical considering Target launched 52 new owened brands in one single year to establish itself as market leader in the big box retail space. - Led various intrapneurial innovation projects including implementation of chat bot implementation for automation of inventory trouble shooting for pilot departments in test markets Execution of Target in India strategy. Defining the milestones for transformation from a ""back office"" mindset to that of an extended head quarter, detailing the action items under culture change, reputation, work ownership etc to enable that change. I raised three kids in the 6 years break. I wrote a lot, mostly to make sense of my diminishing sense of self. I also consulted in a few startups on flexible schedules on projects that excite me and are my strength - branding, product marketing, go-to-market plans, hiring and setting up of client/ customer servicing teams. I also researched alternative ways of education - ranging from homeschooling to radial unschooling, from Montessori to Reggio Emilia. Later I spent a year as the parent counsellor in a child centered Reggio Emilia school called The Atelier for families who want to parent in a child led philosophy. I think the 6 years spent in attending to a home of 3 infants and learning to raise them in ways that challenged the narrative, has been my biggest time of growth. The journey of understanding the sense of self was initiated during this time , and that clarity has served me whenever I needed to take decisions. I have traversed slow, but that has ensured I am on the direction that I want to be."

Kaushik Mukherjee + SUGAR Cosmetics,"Hi, I'm Kaushik and I love building brands! Follow me for candid backstage hits & misses as we build SUGAR Cosmetics into a billion-dollar brand from nothing ??I spent the first 25 years of my life trying to build the perfect CV. Why? Because as a conscientious kid in a middle-class family, EDUCATION was always the bridge to SECURITY and hence, SUCCESS. Engineering at BITS Pilani. Gold-medal awardee at IIM Ahmedabad. Summer internship + pre-placement offer at Goldman Sachs, New York. Never once did I stop to think. What if security was not equal to success? What is success anyway?And then, it started. Declined the investment banking job offer to start up an eCommerce company in 2008. Failed.Raised seed funding from Rediff to run an online insurance portal. Shut down.Ran out of money. Borrowed from friends till I landed a job at McKinsey & Co. Survived.Started up again after two years. And have been building again ever since.Today, I still don't know what success is but I understand what happiness can be. Happiness is the cacophony of creating and the bustle of building. I'm here to share our journey as we build SUGAR Cosmetics over the next decade. Would love to have you clued in on the ride ?? Discussions on Startups, Entrepreneurship, Brand building and Marketing energize me - so does Public Speaking and Knowledge Sharing. Apart from a TEDx Talk, I have spoken at various leadership forums in organizations such as Google, Future Group, Capgemini and more. An IRONMAN triathlete - in 2017, I successfully finished the world's toughest single-day sporting event 4km swim ?? + 180km cycle ??+ 42km run??) in under 17 hrs. While this seems unrelated - it is difficult to express how much I credit this experience for sowing the seeds of endurance in me. Because Entrepreneurship. Takes. Time.Let's Keep Building!??????Currently reside in:Mumbai with my better-half in business/life and two rambunctious kids.Featured in: Fortune 40 Under 40 List 2021, Economic Times, Entrepreneur magazine, Times Of India, YourStory, HT Mint, etc. For more behind-the-scenes banter:??

Kunal Shah + Cred,"Poor nations would consistently remain poor unless they value time and productivity becomes a strong desire/value. Those who desire instant wealth are easy to manipulate. Those who desire instant fame are easiest to manipulate. Extra cautious spenders are like a dam that keep accumulating and end up splurging on emotional life events. Trying to make pennies from them is thus hard and better to be building business around their dam breaks. Starting your own business unleashes a super trait that’s otherwise rarely found: ability to mind your own business. Maturity is outcome of setbacks and heartbreaks. It comes faster to those who went all in on things that didn’t work out. Those who remain shallow in their pursuits rarely get broken and thus are never rebuilt. Leadership is building people to build. Many mistaken it as using people to build. Hiring better than you is only possible if you know yourself well. More often than not, only those who take consistent actions towards their financial wellness create wealth that drastically boosts their net worth. At CRED, we ensure actions towards financial wellness become the default mode for our members. In the month of November: 8.2 lakh CRED members avoided extra interest charges by acting on alerts and paying their bills in full. 90 Cr worth of late payments fees was avoided with the help of timely reminders from CRED. 40.24% of our members improved their credit scores by incorporating the suggested actions from the app. 200 Cr worth of hidden charges were detected by members using CRED Protect. 36 Cr worth of cashback was won by members for taking the right financial decisions."

We couldnt be more grateful to our founders in SEA and co-investors who were patient with us while we learnt about the region. So many of them have shaped our SEA investment journey, heartfelt gratitude. Tons of gratitude to our team members and colleagues in the Singapore office, who work very hard to help founders win every day.

Sequoia India Abheek Anand Rohit Agarwal Aakash Kapoor Johan Surani Gian Adhitya Shenya Wang Anni Cai International listings is the SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT thing India can do for its tech ecosystem. Its not about whether Indian exchanges are good or bad, they're great and theyre improving, but its about founders and boards having choices to do the best thing for their companies. In the next decade, a significant % of top 100 market cap companies from India will be technology companies. Likely the largest sector in public listed universe. It would be a shame if those companies were denied important choices available to global technology companies. AMAZING team Sequoia Capital i need to write to compliance to find out if i can bid too :-) One of the most impressive founder interactions of the year for me was when Hugh Yao came to gave us an update on LingoAce where my partners Abheek Anand Klaus Wang Shenya Wang have been working with the company for several quarters.

Sequoia India Abheek Anand Pieter Kemps Rohit Agarwal Johan Surani Gian Adhitya Shenya Wang Aakash Kapoor Anandamoy Roychowdhary In end-September 2014, I got extremely lucky to run into William Tanuwijaya on my first trip to Jakarta ever. Total serendipity. I recall being very inspired by William's authenticity and a deep commitment to serve merchants. Later that week we agreed on terms to invest in Tokopedia. It was Sequoia India's first investment in Indonesia. A few weeks later, on a subsequent trip to Jakarta, I got introduced to Nadiem Makarim. We had a spirited debate about launching GoFood in the first meeting itself, the app wasnt event launched then. A few weeks later in March 2015, we signed a termsheet to invest in Gojek. The founding team's mission orientation, passion, boldness and focus on user experience were all things we loved. Six years later, all of us at Sequoia India are incredibly grateful, humbled and filled with appreciation for what the teams at Gojek and Tokopedia have achieved. Its not a stretch to say our belief in the SEA market was shaped by our experiences working alongside Andre Soelistyo Kevin Aluwi William Tanuwijaya Patrick Cao Nadiem Makarim and others. We are also very excited about the future of GoTo and the impact it will have in shaping the future of Indonesia."

Shekhar Kirani,"Accel in India. Love to partner with founders. Led investments in Freshworks, Browserstack, Chargebee, FalconX, Zenoti, Amagi, and several others in making Starting to explore startup investing. Love those founders who are taking on big market problems with insights and execution plan for potential success!!! Early stage investments in India. Focus is around Mobile, SaaS, and Enterprise technologies. Partnered with Girish very early in FreshDesk's life... An extraordinary platform that helps any org to improve the quality of their software delivered via browser or mobile app. The most technologically advanced institutional digital asset trading platform in the world Great to see Zenoti helping global wellness brands run their business smoothly What does it mean to be streaming 2B+ hours of video per year? The story of Amagi is extraordinary. I had met Baskar several years back when they were starting SaaS for global markets. The meeting took place in their office in Bangalore, discussing how people would consume content on TV. They predicted that one day, people would enjoy content on TV via streaming v.s. Cable technology. Before it happens, we want to be ready with the best product in the world. It is great to be seeing the accomplishment of Baskar, Srinivasan, and Srividhya, three classmates, coming together and being at it in creating one of the most scalable and highly advanced platforms for streaming content across the globe to any type of end-devices. They kept up with the product innovation and continued to expand the platform to support subscription TV channels and ad-supported TV channels. With solid growth in ARR and one of the highest net expansion among SaaS companies, the company is on a tear. With most of the world just starting to stream, we are excited about the market and business opportunity in front of Amagi. Congratulations to the Amagi team for creating and scaling this great platform. It has been a privilege to be partnering with the team at Amagi for the last several quarters. Oh, I almost forgot. 2B+ hours per year translates to more than 2M households streaming more than 120 minutes per day, 100% on the Amagi platform across the globe. What SaaS got to do with Real-Estate Operations? Real estate from an overall investment and operations perspective is a massive category. But, not a lot of high-quality SaaS companies are in this category. Here is the story of meeting the founders of Facilio and investing in them even before they had started the startup. Love to hear your feedback. Enjoy! #realestate #founders #saas What has grit got to do with founders? This is an extraordinary story of Sharat Potharaju and Ravi Pratap Maddimsetty of MobStac with a lot of lessons and insights for every founder (and investor) to make their own. Sharat and Ravi are epitomai of grit. They are eternal optimists. I have never seen them with their heads down. Every time they fell, they bravely fought back. Now with an amazing product and a great market fit, the team is flying and scaling their business profitably. https://lnkd.in/gRs-fF9Q #founders #business #thegritstories ??????????: What ?????????? do founders use during early days as well as when their startup's scale? Some of my thoughts. Let me know what you think? Here are some of the words founders have used with me and how it changes over time. 1. ?????? ???? ???? ???? ??????????: Early-days lots of YES decisions as they are in the mode of experimentation and every idea looks interesting. Occasional NO decisions. As the company scales, you will start hearing a lot of NOs as they want the org to be focused and keep the company on things that work and matter. Almost no MAYBE words used when they are operating at scale. Successful founders become very decisive. 2. ??????, ????????????????, ???????? ????????, ???????? ??????????, ???????? ??????????????: During early days, especially before PMF, things have to be done in hours (NOW), not even TOMORROW. A lot of things move fast and things break, and things get done in almost real-time to discover the market, product engagement, G2M, positioning, website, advertisements, conversations with potential customers, etc. In fact, the reason startups win is this velocity in finding deep insights into the market. Even things like pushing code to production happen daily and weekly, rarely over months. As the companies scale, founders don't get involved in daily or weekly decisions. They start participating in discussions that have an impact over months and quarters. At scale, if they continue to use NOW or TOMORROW, most likely the company growth will come down OR they don't have a strong layer-1 team. 3. ????????????, ?????????? ??????, ?????? ???? ??????????????????: During early days, so much is happening, there is not even time to enjoy, so lots of THANKS and equivalent acks happen in the startup. Slowly, founders realize the importance of recognizing the contributors (GREAT JOB DONE) in front of other members. As they scale, the further realization is that a lot of team members contribute to any material success and that leads to celebrating the success (LET US CELEBRATE) and less individual performances. 4. ?????????? ????????, ???????? ????????????, ???????????????? ???????? Before PMF, all ideas are half-baked, half-written, with a not-so-great copy. Basically, all things are in DRAFT-MODE, as there is not enough time or data to spend any extra time in experimentation. As the idea starts showing up some results, founders start pushing for GOOD ENOUGH work, as long as the data is showing that the project is moving in the right direction. When startups get more customers, brand, product, team members, founders realize that they cannot push any more DRAFT-MODE work. Credibility matters. They want to see DETAILED PLANs of the projects, all the way from G2M to execution including time and budgets. Yes, it slows down, but, that is where focus comes, and founders start thinking in terms of QUARTERS. Impact words, such as GROWTH, LEADER start being heard as companies mature. Well, this is for some other day. Amazing to see the growth of @chargebee. Do you want to know how? Please read below. We started our journey with Krish Subramanian, Rajaraman Santhanam from the very early days. Hearty congratulations on this raise of $250M at $3.5B. I must narrate one of the untold stories of Chargebee. I use to go to Chennai to meet Girish Mathrubootham at Freshworks after our investment in 2011. On each trip, I would meet Chargebee founders for breakfast (8:30 to 10) and then, a whole day at Freshworks office. This habit continued even after seed investment into Chargebee. One day, Krish and Rajaraman got tired of this arrangement and told me that "".... One day we will make sure you travel to Chennai only to meet us and you do breakfast slot for some other startup..."". Well, that started happening as early as 2014, as the company did an amazing job in scaling their revenues, team, global ambitions and more to discuss in each trip. Hats off to Chargebee team in scaling the company in an extraordinary fashion in the last several years. How? They did amazing things with a maniacal focus. Here are some:1. Customer obsession in terms of service, support, and making sure they are served better. Easier said than done. 2. Superfast product iteration in listening to customers, translating customer requests to product features, and taking product features to production. What I call Concept -> Production in weeks instead of quarters. 3. Every successful company has an amazing employee culture and commitment. Even today, when I talk to the leadership team, I learn something new about how they are thinking about making employees empowered, learning, and contributing. Amazing place for employees. 4. Crazy about supporting and selling to all sizes of customers, just-minted startups to extra-ordinarily large companies. With a great G2M team, the company has built a powerful engine of sales. 5. And, always learning leadership. I am still looking for a call, where, I can say I have read a new book ahead of Krish. The leadership is fearless in saying ""I don't know"" when they don't know, but with strong confidence, they always say ""we will find the best way to do this..."", by learning from others. And many others, but, I must say this is just the beginning of Chargebee's next chapter of scale. Congratulations and welcome to Sequoia India and Tejeshwi Sharma in co-leading this round. Looking forward to their contribution and partnership in making this a massive company, from India to the world! Remote Knowledge Work Any tactical things you do to make teams out of individuals? Team meetings on video are hard. No-agenda catch-ups are gone. Impromptu group chats are not happening. New employees are missing a sense of belonging. Love to hear your playbook for remote work. All the engineers out there: I have a question for you. Do you search code in your code repository? When do you search? If you have written the code, and you find a bug, you know where to go. But, in most cases, you inherit someone else's code and when you see issues to fix or refactor code OR API enhancement, do you search code? What tools do you use? I am trying to assess whether a world-class code search tool (aka Google for code search) helps and accelerates developer time? Yes, there are several open source projects, including OpenGraph, Hound, CodePilot and several others. I am assessing whether this is a ""nice-to-have"" tool or ""must-have"" and would developers pay if this saves time. Here is one google paper that talks a bit about it: https://lnkd.in/gFVk5d_m Amazing progress with Appsmith, one of our seed investment that happened with Abhishek Nayak Nikhil Nandagopal and Arpit Mohan. Building internal apps for productivity and operational excellence has been a pain point from the days of my own coding. Always neglected with most of the engineers being hijacked to customer-facing features. With Appsmith those days are over. - Power to engineers to build internal apps super fast with all the controls necessary. - High-quality/finish UI so that internal users love your work. - Built ground-up as an open-source project with more than 120+ contributors across the globe. Plus, they have more than 7000+ stars on their repository. Very active and fast-growing community. The best part is that all the founders have deep understanding of the needs of internal apps and you will see a great set of integrations to all types of data sources so that one can build apps in hours and days. Congratulations with this Series A and with this raise we should see an acceleration of the platform as well. #coding #locode #opensource Girish Mathrubootham this has been the most humbling experience for me as well. You have been an amazing person, grounded, good in listening and at the same time push back when necessary. This has been a once-in-a-lifetime learning experience for me as well, as Freshworks grew, I have grown along with the company. Thanks for the opportunity to partner with you from the very early days to where we are today. I have cherished every moment of our engagement. I am looking forward to our engagement over the next decade of FRSH. What an amazing day of celebrating the listing of FRSH on NASDAQ./ Amazing day for all of us who work in the startup eco-system. Amazing day for founders across the globe, especially India to think big, dream big, and a possibility of making it happen! Our journey is over 10+ years, when Freshworks was at 6 employees. Girish Mathrubootham and Shan Krishnasamy had a simple formula to win at a global level 1. Pick a large market and continue to expand the market (today - $120B) 2. Build a pixel-perfect world-class product. Delighting the customers in every touch point. 3. Strive 2x the value at 1/2 the cost in every possible way. 4. Focus on hiring the best of the talent. Help them focus on customers. The rest will happen. 5. And help others in the eco-system on the way so that pay-forward is constantly happening in the eco-system. Thanks to this amazing journey for all of us at Accel with Freshworks. #startup #founders"

Siddhartha Gupta,"CEO Mercer Mettl I lead an exciting global technology-focused assessment company (part of a large Global Enterprise). We strive to answer the most important question for Corporates and Education entities which is - Do People Know What They Say They Know? I work with a very talented team in India and across 130 countries where Employers reach out to us to assess candidates and give them confidence that the candidate they want to recruit or develop has the knowledge and skill that they purport to have. Similarly, Education entities use our remote examination engine to conduct remote online invigilated exams to do the same with their students. I joined Mettl when it was exciting B2B Start-up out of India in 2016 and with help of many brilliant individuals, built it into a Global setup growing at a breakneck speed, striving for leadership in this space. My advice for times like these…. · Rethink Process - Every process of value creation for your customers has to be revisited at the fundamental level. · Rethink Talent- Hire and develop the sharpest talent and give them the freedom to take quick decisions. · Rethink Resilience - Transform your set up and make it resilient to physical shut downs by going remote as much as possible. If I can be of any help, do reach out here. Passionately leading Mercer Mettl to make it the largest Online Assessment Company in the World. In an era where “Going Remote” is the new normal for a forceable future, our ability to help Companies & Educational entities go remote with their assessments, authentically and at scale, make us unique. It’s our firm belief that to be successful in these times * Corporate’s need to hire and develop the sharpest talent and give them the freedom to rethink every process of value creation for customers. * Education entities need to transform and become resilient to shut downs by building ability to go remote with class rooms and exams. Mercer Mettl has a decade long experience of doing this for more that 5000 Corporates and 300 Education entities across 90+ countries. Trust of our customers is the only reason that we have maintained a scorching growth rate even in these trying times. Whether it is Talent acquisition, People Development, Community build or Online exams, if you are looking for ideas which will show results in days and weeks…shout out!! We will have the right answers for you. My big leap into the world of Entrepreneurship! I join the dynamic founder duo, Ketan and Tonmoy at Mettl.

Cheers Sid SAP October 2014–Present (9 months) New Delhi, India Vice President Strategic Industries- I took over as VP of Strategic Industries for SAP in India in October. SI has a team of most experienced and talented Sales Professionals supported by a passionate Technical and Industry experts. Our focus is on addressing Automation needs of Public Services, Public Sector Undertaking and Public Utilities. Geographically aligned, have a team of 3 Managers and 17 Sales Directors. This Line of Business is chosen as one of the growth Pillars for SAP in India and I have been tasked to revive SAP’s efforts in the same. I inherit an excellent legacy of Customers, Partners and People. Success Mantra - Less but better (Extreme focus) Key KPI - People (Team, Customer and Partners) should have fun In 2013, SAP India felt a dire need to revive and turn around our performance in core sectors like Oil & Gas (Upstream, Mid-Stream, and Downstream), Petrochemicals, Power Generation, Heavy Engineering and Metals & Mining. A new Sales Sub vertical called “Key -PSU’s within Strategic Industries was created which represented the largest License installed base of SAP India in core Industries. As a leader of this Vertical, I was asked to evangelize SAP’s innovations for these industries, recruit, train and retain a team of five Senior Account Directors for: - Rebuilding SAP’s position as a trusted advisor to the Boards of these Companies. - Introducing SAP’s innovations to the customers, partners and the influencers. - Created capabilities with in SAP and with the external stakeholders to address the needs of these customers better. - Built high growth and sustainable business for SAP in this sector. Over the course of my tenure, SAP has regained its presence in this Strategic Sub-Vertical, we achieved a performance which is more than double of SAP’s average performance from this sector in the last 5 years. I have also created a team (Account Directors and Virtual Account Team) which is passionate about making a difference every single day. SAP India formed a new Line of Business (LOB) called Public Services in 2008. Our objective was to scale up SAP's share of wallet in the automation spends of Central Government, State Government and Utilities. I moved from SAP's regional office in Bangalore to lead a part of this team. As a team, over 5 years we made SAP a dominant player in many industries namely Ports, Airports, Defence, Utility (Generation, transmission & Distribution), Chemical & Fertilizer, Railways etc. In 2012, the team strength was three Managers for North, East and Central Government and 8 Account Managers reporting to them. The experience of driving some of the most complex sales cycles and managing a very talented team of professionals has been inspiring. Some noteworthy achievements are - Our empanelment at DGS&D and NICSI, Indian Navy's automation, our foray into Indian Railways, Airports, Indian Airlines, automation of Department of Post, Significant wins in Utility Sector namely Power Grid and more than 10 State Distribution entities under the APDRP program. Post Compaq's acquisition by HP, I decided to move into the Southern Regional Sales team of HP Operating out of their Bangalore office. Managed every part of HP's businesses starting from PC's and Entry Level Servers to Complex Enterprise Solutions and Services offerings to Large Companies like Unilever, Wipro etc. This was the most coveted post created in Compaq Computers; every Business School intern had to compete for this role. Designed as one year tenure, EA to the MD literally got a ring side view to running a Multinational company in India. This stint gave me the privilege to work with one of the most admirable Business leaders of India. Compaq’s Top Management included Neelam Dhawan, current MD of HP India, Rajeev Srivastava, Som Satsangi, Kapil Jain, Zarir Batliwala and other illustrious members who are at the helm of affairs of many leading Technology Companies in India (including HP)"

Soorya + CONSCIENTIOUSNESS,"Alex was conscientious and he would never ask his employees to do anything he wouldn't do. She was conscientious with regard to her duties as examiner. All Wiseman's later years were darkened by Errington's conscientious but implacable hostility to Manning, and to himself in so far as he was supposed to be acting under Manning's influence. There is no evidence that any speech in Acts is the free composition of its author, without either written or oral basis; and in general he seems more conscientious than most ancient historians touching the essentials of historical accuracy, even as now understood. There can be no doubt that Professor Burmeister discharged his editorial duty with the most conscientious scrupulosity; but, from what has been just said, it is certain that there were important points on which Nitzsch was as yet undecided - some of them perhaps of which no trace appeared in his manuscripts, and therefore as in every case of works posthumously published, unless (as rarely happens) they have received their author's "" imprimatur,"" they cannot be implicitly trusted as the expression of his final views. To be a truly conscientious artist, you have to look at what's not working and challenge it. You riff on things. I am a Quaker. And as everyone knows, Quakers, for 300 years, have, on conscientious ground, been against participating in war. I was sentenced to three years in federal prison because I could not religiously and conscientiously accept killing my fellow man. In Japan, I live in a little neighborhood in the middle of nowhere. I don't have a bicycle or a car or anything, so my only movement is within the boundaries of my feet. I feel there's a need for that kind of conscientious objection to the momentum of the world. If there is any God, there is only one way to please him, and that is by a conscientious discharge of your obligations to your fellow men."
Soorya + DOMINANCE,"6 The Piaroa view the arrogant and dominating character, which the Shavante would highly esteem in a mature male, as odious. 14 The largest object for miles, dominating the shallow depression which is the valley of the Ancre, is the Thiepval Memorial. 25 Anyone who has used Glasgow Airport can not fail to have noticed the huge domed building dominating Paisley's skyline. 7 A dominating defensive player, the 34-year-old Mutombo also has been extremely durable. 8 She thought it majestic, dominating the city without overwhelming it. We who are dominant tend to think of that aspect of being a werewolf as rank: who is obeyed, who is to obey. Dominant and submissive. But it is also who is to protect and who is to be protected. A submissive wolf is not incapable of protecting himself: he can fight, he can kill as readily as any other. But a submissive doesn't feel the need to fight -- not the way a dominant does. They are a treasure in a pack. A source of purpose and of balance. Why does a dominant exist? To protect those beneath him, but protecting a submissive is far more rewarding because a submissive will never wait until you are wounded or your back is turned to see if you are truly dominant to him. Submissive wolves can be trusted. And they unite the pack with the goal of keeping them safe and cared for. Dominance. Control. These things the unjust seek most of all. And so it is the duty of the just to defy dominance and to challenge control. It was all Mrs. Bumble. She would do it,"" urged Mr. Bumble; first looking round, to ascertain that his partner had left the room. That is no excuse,"" returned Mr. Brownlow. ""You were present on the occasion of the destruction of these trinkets, and, indeed, are the more guilty of the two, in the eye of the law; for the law supposes that your wife acts under your direction."" If the law supposes that,"" said Mr. Bumble, squeezing his hat emphatically in both hands, ""the law is a ass — a idiot. If that's the eye of the law, the law is a bachelor; and the worst I wish the law is, that his eye may be opened by experience — by experience. One of the easiest ways to dominate a man is to demand something he cannot supply."
Soorya + INFLUENCE,"Recent years have seen a decline in the company's influence within the industry. Her ideas have gradually gained influence in the company. He used his influence to reform the company's policies. She has remained under the influence of her parents. She claims that her personal problems played no influence upon her decision to resign. His health problems may have had some influence on his decision. Her parents still have a great deal of influence over her. The chairman wields considerable influence over the board's decisions. Her parents are concerned that her new friends may have a bad influence on her. Emily Dickinson has had a major influence on his poetry. If you are given a chance to be a role model, I think you should always take it because you can influence a person’s life in a positive light, and that’s what I want to do. That’s what it’s all about. Your minds influence the key activity of the brain, which then influences everything; perception, cognition, thoughts and feelings, personal relationships; they’re all a projection of you. If you were born with the ability to change someone’s perspective or emotions, never waste that gift. It is one of the most powerful gifts God can give – the ability to influence. Nobody should be whipped. Remember that, once and for all. Neither man nor animal can be influenced by anything but suggestion. Don’t be a pepper on the eyes of people; Rather be the salt on their tongue and make a difference that influences their sense of belonging to the earth. The real beginning of influence comes as others sense you are being influenced by them ? when they feel understood by you ? that you have listened deeply and sincerely, and that you are open. You don’t have to be a person of influence to be influential. In fact, the most influential people in my life are probably not even aware of the things they’ve taught me. No matter how much you love the person, you cannot change them. You may influence them; but at the end of the day, they must decide for themselves. Some of the most important decisions I have made might well have never been made or might have been very different if it hadn’t been for the influence of the people in my life. We all need mentors."
Soorya + STEADINESS,"It requires a training such as the athletes underwent, the steady intention almost of the whole life to this object. The steady tendency of Russian society towards increasing the number of secondary schools, where instruction would be based on the study of the natural sciences, is checked by the government in favour of the classical gymnasiums. 5 Sunday schools and public lectures are virtually prohibited. His heartbeat was strong and steady, the thick arm wrapped around her as it had been when he held her after they'd made love for the last time before falling asleep. This high mean pressure cannot be maintained for long, because as the speed increases the demand for steam per unit of time increases, so that cut-off must take place earlier and earlier in the stroke, the limiting steady speed being attained when the rate at which steam is supplied to the cylinders is adjusted by the cut-off to be equal to the maximum rate at which the boiler can produce steam, which depends upon the maximum rate at which coal can be burnt per square foot of grate. In the depths of horror and despair, one comes to a new steadiness. There is no farther to fall. We don’t have to be fast; we simply have to be steady and move in the right direction. Direction is always going to trump speed. If you make an inner-intent to remain steady in a completely unsteady atmosphere, you will be able to remain steady. This is because steadiness is indeed the quality of your own Self-form. So then, what do You have do with what is unsteady? A thousand good deeds can be undone with one flash of anger. As a mature adult, you can master your affect and through it, provide the world with a steadiness and strength that is badly needed in this complicated age. People say that steadiness of mind is an end; no, it is a beginning. I am there; I can explain everything up to that point. Then I struggle to discover what comes after, so this steadiness is not an end, it is the beginning and the instrument. Our part is to pursue with steadiness what is right, turning neither to right nor left for the intrigues or popular delusions of the day, assured that the public approbation will, in the end, be with us."
Sridhar Ranganathan + B2Brain,"B2B selling was long impending an overhaul, and 2020 only acted as a catalyst. It's no surprise that remote sales exploded in 2020.While most B2B companies and sales teams adapted rather quickly, it came at a price. - Modern B2B sales tech stacks took care of everything but account research, and it stuck out like a sore thumb. - SDRs *had* to ensure their pitches were personalized, relevant, well-timed, and contextual. It meant more time and effort for account research vs. making the calls. - A usual target account research that took 20-25 mins now took hours together. - Google and LinkedIn Sales Navigator didn't make the research easier. And why would they? SDRs weren't their target audience, and account research wasn't their problem. So, SDRs had to sweep through an overload of information to find something remotely relevant.The struggle was evident, but there was no solution out there. And that's why we started B2Brain. SDRs wanted answers to two specific questions: - How do I get insights from the target account relevant to my business? - Who are the people I should pursue in the target accounts? B2Brain set out to help SDRs get account intelligence unique to their business directly inside their existing CRMs and SEPs. Try it out for yourself.

I gained very valuable experience over these six months travelling alone on a shoestring budget overland from Europe to Asia. I travelled 3500 kms from Portugal to Greece by bicycle over 3 months and continued overland from Turkey to Kazakhstan through public transport and hitchhiking.

What are your thoughts on this? #revops #crm #salesintelligence As a Sales Leader, from 2007 - 2015 - first week of every new quarter - 9am to 5pm (sometime till mid-night) - for 2 continuous days, I would engage in QBR with my sales team. This would involve understanding the efforts they put in the past quarter, their current pipeline and hard commit numbers. Almost every QBR, I struggled. Do you have a similar story? #QBR #SalesReviews #Sales #salesforecasting #storytelling #salestips #cros #crmsoftware #salesenablement Have you seen our new home page? We designed it for you.

Hopefully I did justice to his questions. I also touch upon how sales has changed in the last 2 decades. Few anecdotes from my 2+ decades in sales. One such example being being invited for family lunch by the client, post the sale. Comment by Ranjith Doshi made my day “Going to client for lunch post the deal win is the best form of selling because you have won over the person more than his business.

Does it resonate with you? #sales #innovation #ai #artificialintelligence #salesforecasting The secret to winning. Why few companies win most deals. The winners are not massively different from the runner ups. They are little different, but the little difference leads to massive - winner takes it all. Remember the 2008 men's 100-meter butterfly race in Beijing, where Michael Phelps beat Milorad Cavic by only 4.7 mm (To put it in context, that's possibly size of a pea) Organisations that do the right things repeatedly maintain the slight edge over the competition which leads to massive gains over a period. #successfulbusiness #sales #winners #win #winning #secrets #success #network #life #work #entrepreneurship #friendsofrelatas #management #technology #future #india #customerrelations A quick weekend read.

He saw and recognized, and said: Him - Aren't you the CEO of Relatas. I'm sorry can't recollect your name, but I very well remember what Relatas Sales AI does. We looked at few options and my VP sales and VP operations are really excited about Relatas, we love the no-data-entry CRM and the AI based actionable insights. Can someone from your team give us a demo next week. Me - Hi <name>, nice to bump into you here. Where are you traveling to? I'm Sudip, and I'm happy to hear that we sold Relatas well enough for you to remember what we do. Happy to give you a demo coming week. We'll get in touch with your team. Me thinking - he remembers the company name, remembers what we do, possibly researched a little more, VP sales and VP operations are excited about Relatas. - What has been your experience? Is personal brand more important than product brand? I believe both are equally important, but if in the first meeting the customer remembers the product brand more than your personal brand, then you are on the right growth path. That indicates that any good sales person can now sell the product. Some pleasures of writing when your flight is delayed #sales #branding #personalbranding #productbranding Wish you all #salesProfessionals a successful Sales fulfilling 2019. #sales If you are in #Toronto, #Vancouver, #Calgary, #SanFrancisco, let us know.

I had a interesting conversation over the weekend on types of Sales professionals. The discussion started on how most start up entrepreneurs are product guys and not sales people and mostly harp on the features of the product rather than a story. Link to my article: Your best wishes come in various mediums. A prospect called in today and said ""Hi, I'm the Sales Head at ABC, Relatas was highly recommended by one of your existing customers. When can we have a demo. And, Happy Holi"". Happy Holi to all of you. This Valentines Day, Love Thy Customer. The feeling you get when your customers love you back.

Pl. go through the below link before you apply: https://lnkd.in/e-Z2f6b How important are the first 90 days in sales? 90 days has an important impact on businesses. All businesses have quarterly (90 day) targets. Most of the leaders who join organisations have a 30-60-90 day plan to prove that they have in it to take the company where they have promised to take it. This is the best period to prove that you are an asset to the organisation. Do you set a 30-60-90 day plan for your new recruits? Check out what Sudhir Kulkarni, Gaurav Rastogi and Gaurav Suri have to say about it: #digitalsales #sales #socialselling #contentmarketing #AI #ArtificialIntelligence #CRM Who are the best Sales Enablement Professionals you know? Would love to get their views on what is working for them and what is not and how they interact with the sales teams. Tag yourself or someone you worked with. Thanks in advance for the help. Sunday 9:00am A Prospect called Sunday morning enquiring about us. Discussion went well and I suggested a demo. Prospect: Since its Sunday I'm going out with family and would like to get to the demo late Sunday evening at around 10:30pm. ME: No problem, will get to the demo. Sunday evening 10:30pm - 10:45pm: Prospect: No response. Monday morning 7:30am Prospect: I came in late last night, can we do the demo now. ME: Sure. Lets get to it. Monday morning 8:30am: Deal done. What do sales people need to sell more? Motivation (BEAT). Motivation could be in various forms 1. Bonus - Bonus if you achieve your target 2. Ego - Something I did that no one else could 3. Appreciation - Appreciation from the team, management 4. Trust - Trust is a great motivator, if you haven't tried it yet try it. I was invited to an event yesterday and we were discussing #Trust issues, why do people don't trust people or why do people trust other people. There was a great definition that Kunal Shah referred to - something on these lines ""When you open your vulnerabilities to someone, you trust that person"" What has worked for you/ your team? I have been selling “professionally” for about 18 years, and overall for over three decades. When someone says s/he hasn't sold anything, anytime, that’s not true. We all sell something every day. When you go for interviews, you are selling your capabilities. When you go on a date, you are selling your charm. When you meet your boss, you are trying to sell something else. So in our daily lives we always sell something. People buy from people they like - You will not buy a car from a salesperson if you don’t like the salesperson; well you may in extreme cases. I hope you get the point. In this case the car salesperson tries to understand your requirements. S/he tries to understand you and your family and then proposes the salient features of the car. More on my post here: https://lnkd.in/eGUFWrw A group of blind men heard that a strange animal, called an elephant, had been brought to the town, but none of them were aware of its shape and form. Out of curiosity, they said: ""We must inspect and know it by touch, of which we are capable"". So, they sought it out, and when they found it they groped about it. In the case of the first person, whose hand landed on the trunk, said ""This being is like a thick snake"". For another one whose hand reached its ear, it seemed like a kind of fan. As for another person, whose hand was upon its leg, said, the elephant is a pillar like a tree-trunk. The blind man who placed his hand upon its side said, ""elephant is a wall"". Another who felt its tail, described it as a rope. The last felt its tusk, stating the elephant is that which is hard, smooth and like a spear. - Wikipedia In the same way, most of us look at small pieces of information and try to deduce the outcome without looking at the complete picture. Most discussions get into conflicts because not all have the complete picture. What does it take to comment/ commit/ speak after we have the complete picture?

Increased vaccination rates, pent-up demand & accumulated savings helped in demand recovery of global tourism in 2021 as nationwide lockdown eased & countries rolled back border restrictions. Although Global revenue passenger kilometers (RPK), an important airline metric that shows the number of kilometers traveled by paying passengers has only reached 40% of pre-covid levels but next year, airline revenue growth projection for regions like North America & Middle East look optimistic. Demand in hotel industry saw fastest recovery in Middle East, approx. 87% recovery from pre-covid levels, followed by Americas at 74%. While the Asian markets have been a bit slow to recover in comparison to their global peers, hopeful that 2022 will bring in a stronger retrieval (fingers crossed – Omicron/ any other variant shouldn’t wreak havoc) Interesting read from CNBC highlighting recovery trends & travel related forecast for 2022.

Does empowering customers with more information really help them make better decisions? Most commonly believed thought by us is that satisfying customers’ every request for information and support makes buying easier. This may sound counterintuitive but believe me piling on more information and options just makes things harder for customers while making decisions. In fact, one of the researches done by CEB & as included in the book “The New Sales Imperative” depicts that one of the perils of responsiveness & information deluge is decrease in the likeliness of purchase ease and increase in the likeliness of purchase regret. On the contrary, a proactive, prescriptive approach that guides customers through decision making increases the likelihood of purchase ease. Prescription may take many forms, but the companies that have mastered it employ the same practices: They work to deeply understand the customer’s purchase journey; identify the most significant customer challenge at each buying stage; arm their salespeople with tools to help overcome each challenge; and trace the customer’s progress so that they can intervene at any moment to keep the process on track. #thoughtfulthursday Is the charm of solution selling fading away & metamorphosing into a different form of B2B selling. Under the conventional solution-selling method that has prevailed since Adam was a boy, salespeople are trained to align a solution with an acknowledged customer need. This approach worked earlier because customers didn’t know how to solve their own problems, even though they often had a good understanding of what their problems were. But now, owing to increasing availability of information armed with troves of data, companies can readily define solutions for themselves. In fact, today customers are coming to the table armed to the teeth with a deep understanding of their problem and a well-scoped proposal for a solution. It’s turning many of the sales conversations into fulfillment conversations. Hence, traditional solution selling is replaced with insight selling that rests on the belief that salespeople must lead with disruptive ideas that will make customers aware of unknown needs. Adaptive sales reps, who seek out customers that are primed for change, challenge them with provocative insights, and coach them on how to buy, will become indispensable. They may still be selling solutions—but more broadly, they’re selling insights. #thoughtfulthursday I know, Mr. Srikant is actively looking out for a job in the private sector. A shoutout to my LinkedIn connects to explore opportunities that peak his interest. Here is a sneak peak into his interesting chat with Ritesh Agarwal #TheFamilyMan #TheFamilyManwithOYO #JobforSrikant #AmazonPrime OYO As OYOpreneurs, nothing gives us more satisfaction than reflecting upon our efforts to help the nation during these challenging times.

We are doing our bit with OYO Care. HT's coverage on our OYO Care initiative. OYO Our new Isolation facility is live in Bangalore which will provide accommodation, meals & moderate medical care to mild/asymptomatic Covid patients.

You’ve likely known or read about someone who seems to have the golden touch when it comes to management. No matter what they do, their teams seem to excel. The reason for such success is often misunderstood. Usually, it’s attributed to the manager’s ability to organize people, institute processes, and adapt as new information becomes available. There’s little doubt that these skills matter. But the other, less discussed aspect of a successful manager’s behavior is this: They hire and nurture the right people so that they perform to the best of their abilities. No amount of guiding, organizing, or process improvement is going to make a team with the wrong people in the wrong roles perform well. Good managers know this and do the hard work of getting the people part right. Extending the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) further and widening its scope to cover hospitality, tourism, and related sectors will definitely help MSMEs as 70 per cent enterprises in this sector are small businesses. Although magnitude of the direct impact of this scheme in the travel & tourism sector is dubitable since hospitality, travel & tourism, leisure & sporting sectors would also now be vying along with 27 sectors added under ECLGS 2.0 scope in November 2020 to the original scheme. It atleast makes for a good deal for people to repay loans after two years as part of the scheme. https://lnkd.in/dhBksBr In continuation with the last post in the management myths buster series, here’s the next myth that I believe needs to be busted. #Myth2 Management & Leadership are two peas in a pod You must know which role you play the best & the strengths you bring to it. It’s possible to be a great manager & not a great leader or vice versa. Many of us might have experienced working with a manager with little leadership ability. Whenever the ways of working need to change due to internal or external changes, the manager who lacks leadership ability often struggles to “rally the troops” to a new normal. Similarly, a great leader who has little managerial skills can pull a team in several directions with clarity of vision and positive buzz. Hence it’s critical for a company that great managers either learn leadership skills or align themselves with good leaders. Thoughts?"
