We're working with AI and ML companies in the Bay Area. Every week, we meet at least one company that is experiencing the sales cycle-of-doom. The sales teams end up getting fired, or the marketing team is being reshuffled. All this wastes time in the market, and even a great product will lose momentum, not to mention expensive VC money. But why is this happening? B2B sales is changing, and a completely new approach is needed to develop markets. Without a complete team, market development efforts will be half-hearted and unresponsive. Do Loop Digital are experts in storytelling, marketing, sales and customer success, but more importantly, we know what companies need to build a growth rocket.

Lead and transform this $7bn global sales organization back to being the industry's #1. This requires active leadership, mastery of sales strategy and in driving complex change in a thousand-plus global field force. His latest role had a three-pronged charter, described below. 1. Drive long-term Revenue and Relationship growth for more than half the company's revenues (>$3.5 bn) through its forty-plus investment (STAR) accounts. Building a Client Partner leadership layer, a sustained ecosystem of other leadership roles. Instill the power of discipline, new ideas and deep relationships with each STAR client. Responsible for long-term Revenues, pipeline health and relationship quality. 2. Value Design is the name for the new Pursuit Engine that's helping Infosys consistently win more deals at all existing and new accounts. Gaurav has created this new team that brings to each pursuit the power of sales discipline, methodical offering design and a heavy infusion of hunger. Responsible for conversion rates, win consistency and order book increases. 3. Lead the global Practice Sales organization that brings expertise into every client conversation.This expert team manages three-fifths of the company's $7bn revenues. Their expertise needs to continue to be sharp in a matrixed and fast evolving global organization. In 2007, Infosys was looking for ways to enter new services that could leverage and extend its core business model without dipping into its traditional talent pool. Gaurav created the strategy to enter a new service line, secured board approval, and created a completely new Learning Services business. Under Gaurav, Learning Services started with zero existing clients and employees and opened 55 clients. The team's work relies on solution selling, and the solutions Gaurav's team has created, including one for which Gaurav has a patent filed under his name, are accepted in the market as being innovative and efficient. Gaurav also designed a global delivery process for this service line. The ($5bn) company’s foray into a new service (learning services) hinged upon the creation of a new global delivery process that could handle iterative development, which was strikingly different from the company’s preferred waterfall methodology. The process was designed from scratch, and delivered much higher client satisfaction (measurable, but data can't be shared publicly), and was able to do this with a higher global effort share (85% compared with the company’s average of 70%). Expertise in frugal innovation. Gaurav has created two new offerings that deliver more value to clients while reducing the price point and still making more profits. The award-winning solution for “Sustained End-User Adoption and Learning (SEAL)” uses a prudent approach to a common problem with ERP-led-transformation projects. Also created Infosys’ first productized service offering- LITE- that simplifies the sale of small projects while simultaneously being more profitable than business as usual. Driven a Sales Process transformation at Infosys, then a $1 bn services company, that increased sales productivity 3x through transformative sales process redesign, performance management process redesign, career redefinition and comprehensive training for Infosys’ client services team. As part of this work, Gaurav led the successful implementation of new CRM processes as part of the OTR processes for Infosys, by then a $3bn global company. The company gain better visibility over revenue pipeline, and better control over multi-service sales. Global Sales Effectiveness is a transformation program targeted at the client services team. The role reports to the WW Head of Sales and is aimed at realigning the client services organization with Infosys’ strategic objectives.

He teaches classes on Problem Solving, Developing Client Relationships, as well as created and delivered original content on Making Great Presentations, Whiteboarding for Success, and Putting Infographics to Work. Gaurav also created the talent management framework that Infosys still uses, ten years later, for managing its client services group.

Leveraging digital I started my career in 1989 and I have played different roles. For about ten years, I ran my own business. Subsequently, I worked for a few big companies for another decade. Since 2011, I did my PhD and also consulted with Yahoo, Wipro, TCS and IIIT-Bangalore. I set up an experimental site called Recoplace and ran it for two years. Recoplace was an attempt to gather recommendations from all over the world, with a focus on home remedies practiced in different places and cultures.I completed my PhD in Jan 2018. Since then I have been a Professor at KSIT and a Consultant to different companies. An offshoot of my Doctoral work has led to an improved edge detection method. I have used this method to help improve the quality of retinal images of premature babies. The goal is to improve detection of Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) when diagnostics is done remotely. The method is undergoing clinical trials in two hospitals. I work as a technical consultant with different companies. My work is broadly around analytics using video and images. I have worked with NeST (now part of Quest) to help bring a new team up to speed on Video technologies required for a surveillance application. I have worked with Wipro to help build analytics solutions for retail applications. I have worked with TCS on an IP component that I proposed to them. This was to measure End User Video Quality for internet video providers. I work with a few startups to help conceive and design solutions in the space of autonomous vehicles, mobile apps and security. Recoplace is a social media platform to share and find credible recommendations from people one knows. People benefit a lot from high quality recommendations. Many of us have come to treasure a book someone recommended or maybe music someone introduced us to and many other things we “discovered” because of someone. A special kind of discovery is home cures. Cures that someone recommends, and sometimes, works like magic. Recoplace makes the sharing and discovering of recommendations easier. Courses I offer are in two areas, low level communication technologies and video technologies. My research is totally focused on Video technologies for the internet and mobility space. In 2013 I have had around 20 grad students working with me on semester long projects in the area of Video technologies. All these projects, directly or indirectly, explored concepts of quality in internet video.

HackerRank is making the world flat... fast! Our mission is to build a meritocratic platform that makes the world flat – where the only thing that matters is your actual objectively-measured skill and not which school you went to or the companies you’ve been at, or your gender, or how privileged you’ve been. HackerRank is a fast growing technical talent community used by programmers to hone their coding skills and by companies to recruit tech talent. It's about SKILL not school. It really is that simple. What school you went to doesn't mean you're a great engineer, it means you went to that school. Hackerrank is here to help organizations identify the best engineering talent by the work product they produce. Simple. You get a high score on a code challenge, you're qualified. Low score - you're not qualified. Simple! Our customers can now look beyond Tier 1 engineering schools or only at top engineering companies and find skilled engineer talent where they current live - everywhere. The publicly accessible platform found at HackerRank.com is a community where coders go to compete for fun, education, prizes, and jobs. Programming problems span several domains including artificial intelligence and algorithms. Companies can also participate on this platform by sponsoring challenges that can include real-world problems that any coder in the world can compete to try and solve. HackerRank for Work is our B2B enterprise product and is a set of tools for technical interviewing and assessment that sits on top of our platform. These tools simplify the interview process for any company that hires engineers. HackerRank for Work can be found at http://www.hackerrank.com/work. Taking on larger responsibilities of growing the team and region. Continued to manage & grow the team and business through these years. In these three years, particularly proud of the growth we achieved along with the professional transformation of team members taking up different roles with larger responsibilities. Presidents club FY 2017, 2018, 2019 & 2020. As part of my role here at HackerRank, I am responsible for sales of India and APAC. My primary responsibility includes increasing awareness of our solutions and growing sales in our most important and promising geography. I have the privilege of inheriting a small rock star team and build it up from here. Entrusted with the task of expanding our presence across geographies. I also consider it an honor to be working with some of the most brilliant tech minds internally and externally as part of this role. In this role as Senior Enterprise Relationship Manager, I handled some of our large India & global Strategic customers and I consulted and enabled them to achieve their hiring objectives on a global scale. I had the good fortune to work closely with some very talented, brilliant and seasoned industry veterans. Everyday was a wonderful learning experience. I enjoyed spending time with my clients, showing them some amazing data insights that enabled them make some business critical decisions. What I loved about my role was that I got to spend time with grass root level sourcers/recruiters as well as Exec & CXO's, wherein I got to do customized workshops and to show them the power of LinkedIn and social media in general and how it was changing the face of recruiting. As the first Enterprise Relationship Manager in the south of India, I took over the task of handling all our SMB, Enterprise and Strategic customers. I was the third employee of our line of business at our Bangalore office. The best part of this stint was that I felt like an entrepreneur, since I was the first Relationship Manager for the south and I had to set up things for myself. This was an extremely exciting phase wherein I was establishing the foundation of our business and very proud to say that my stint here help lay a very strong foundation for the other Relationship Managers who joined after me. As a Relationship Manager, wherein LinkedIn was in its infancy in India, my immediate job was to make sure all our clients adopted LinkedIn's Talent Solutions and were setting up themselves for success with this medium. This would include a lot of education and hand holding. I traveled pretty extensively to all client locations in India during this phase to ensure that all users and stake holders across levels were educated and brought up to speed on social media and LinkedIn in specific. Making LinkedIn a way of life for my clients was our vision and still continues to be! During this phase of my career, I moved into an Individual contributor role and handled some of our larger strategic customers. Primarily my task involved customer retention and satisfaction. I was assigned a set of some of our large customers in Bangalore and I would meet up with them, assess their hiring needs/challenges, propose solutions to help achieve those challenges, organize trainings, up sell and renew them. I was part of the Key Accounts team which was responsible for probably >50% of the branch revenues. This was technically my first sales job and the one that probably laid the foundation for my sales career. I was one of the first few employees of our Bangalore branch and had the opportunity to see and learn how a business is scaled up. Naukri.com was pretty much in its infancy and this phase of my career saw me start off as a feet on street field sales person to handling a team of 4 members. I enjoyed every role that I played. I was assigned a territory within Bangalore and my task was to ensure that the entire territory is mapped and we have demonstrated and educated our prospects on our solutions. All the efforts put in initially with all the cold calls led to prospects being converted to clients.During this stint of mine, I also helped set up our new office space right from identifying the office space to getting everything from the wood work to electrical fittings to interiors to almost everything in the office set up. Apart from being a full time sales professional, I did this purely for the love of it and very proud of this even today!Sales Leader | Enterprise Technology | Digital Transformation.

All Wiseman's later years were darkened by Errington's conscientious but implacable hostility to Manning, and to himself in so far as he was supposed to be acting under Manning's influence. There is no evidence that any speech in Acts is the free composition of its author, without either written or oral basis; and in general he seems more conscientious than most ancient historians touching the essentials of historical accuracy, even as now understood. There can be no doubt that Professor Burmeister discharged his editorial duty with the most conscientious scrupulosity; but, from what has been just said, it is certain that there were important points on which Nitzsch was as yet undecided - some of them perhaps of which no trace appeared in his manuscripts, and therefore as in every case of works posthumously published, unless (as rarely happens) they have received their author's ' imprimatur,' they cannot be implicitly trusted as the expression of his final views. To be a truly conscientious artist, you have to look at what's not working and challenge it. You riff on things. I am a Quaker. And as everyone knows, Quakers, for 300 years, have, on conscientious ground, been against participating in war. I was sentenced to three years in federal prison because I could not religiously and conscientiously accept killing my fellow man. In Japan, I live in a little neighborhood in the middle of nowhere. I don't have a bicycle or a car or anything, so my only movement is within the boundaries of my feet. I feel there's a need for that kind of conscientious objection to the momentum of the world.
