Subsequently, I worked for a few big companies for another decade. Since 2011, I did my PhD and also consulted with Yahoo, Wipro, TCS and IIIT-Bangalore. I set up an experimental site called Recoplace and ran it for two years. Recoplace was an attempt to gather recommendations from all over the world, with a focus on home remedies practiced in different places and cultures.I completed my PhD in Jan 2018. Since then I have been a Professor at KSIT and a Consultant to different companies. An offshoot of my Doctoral work has led to an improved edge detection method. I have used this method to help improve the quality of retinal images of premature babies. The goal is to improve detection of Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) when diagnostics is done remotely. The method is undergoing clinical trials in two hospitals. I work as a technical consultant with different companies. My work is broadly around analytics using video and images. I have worked with NeST (now part of Quest) to help bring a new team up to speed on Video technologies required for a surveillance application. I have worked with Wipro to help build analytics solutions for retail applications. I have worked with TCS on an IP component that I proposed to them. This was to measure End User Video Quality for internet video providers. I work with a few startups to help conceive and design solutions in the space of autonomous vehicles, mobile apps and security. Recoplace is a social media platform to share and find credible recommendations from people one knows. People benefit a lot from high quality recommendations. Many of us have come to treasure a book someone recommended or maybe music someone introduced us to and many other things we \u201cdiscovered\u201d because of someone. A special kind of discovery is home cures. Cures that someone recommends, and sometimes, works like magic. Recoplace makes the sharing and discovering of recommendations easier. Courses I offer are in two areas, low level communication technologies and video technologies. My research is totally focused on Video technologies for the internet and mobility space. In 2013 I have had around 20 grad students working with me on semester long projects in the area of Video technologies. All these projects, directly or indirectly, explored concepts of quality in internet video.","Chief Revenue Officer at HackerRank.

After quitting my first job at BYJUs in Dec 2012, I decided to take a 1-year break to figure out 'what next'. To survive in B'luru, I did a bunch of odd jobs \ud83d\udc47 \ud83d\udcdd started tutoring a couple of French kids at a nearby apartment in the evenings; grew to 4 via word of mouth \ud83d\ude07 \ud83d\ude80 helped an ex-colleague get his offline coaching biz off the ground on weekends \u270d started freelance writing; my first article was for a publication called trak.in. It went viral according to Arun Prabhudesai (the founder and Chief Editor at that point in time). During this 10-11 month period, startups had started getting attention. Bangalore was the hub! \ud83e\udd29 YourStory (YS) and PluggdIn (now NextBigWhat) were the only two media entities that really cared about Startups back then. I'd make time to attend startup events - mostly by YourStory. I remember meeting Joe Gebbia* at the YS office (which was a 3.5 BHK on the 2nd floor of a 3-story building right behind Toit in Indiranagar). 40-50 of us crammed in a small hall to listen to *the co-founder of Airbnb - one of the biggest startup stories from the US. \ud83d\udd25 After a while, having attended several meetups, I got to know each and every member of the (then small) team at YS. I remember Shradha Sharma (Founder, YourStory) offered me a lift back from one such conference at Taj Yeshwanthpur in Oct 2013. We stopped for ice cream at a H\u00e4agen-Dazs in 1-MG mall. This is where she asked me to join YourStory to help with community building. I already knew the team members + having started a startup while still in college I was massively curious about startups. This decision was a no-brainer. I joined YourStory as a consultant in Nov, '13. This was the best thing that happened to me.
